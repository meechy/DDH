This repository contains the core code responsible for triggering and handling the DuckDuckHack instant answers. It is the base of the 
DuckDuckHack Instant Answer infrastructure.  

If you're reporting an issue with an instant answer, please add the issue to an appropriate Instant Answer repo (either [Goodies](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/issues), [Spice](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice/issues), [Fathead](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead/issues) or [Longtail](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-longtail/issues)).
