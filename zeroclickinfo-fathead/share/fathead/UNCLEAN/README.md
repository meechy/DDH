This is a copy of the orginal parsers used to generate the API
documentation for searchcode.com which were shared with DDG back
in the early days. Note while it conforms to a standard of SQL and
TSV its not in line with the current DDG fathead standards and will
need to be updated. The code is also 100% awful. Some of the parsers
were works in progress so will not work.
